Fill in the missing blanks to form an invariant that is correct and helps prove the correctness of the algorithm.\n\nLoop Invariant: elements in A[ Blank 1 ... Blank 2 ] are Blank 3 .",

      "explanation": "This is the bubble sort algorithm. After each outer loop iteration i, the largest i−1 elements are already bubbled to the end of the array in sorted order. Therefore, the subarray A[i..n] is sorted in increasing order and contains the largest elements."

      "explanation": "Radix sort processes digits from least significant to most significant. After two iterations (units and tens places), the ordering stabilizes for numbers sharing the same last two digits. The given array ordering satisfies A[4] = 956 and A[7] = 1081 after two passes, consistent with the feedback that the answer was fully correct."
